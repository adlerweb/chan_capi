- better counting of active B-channels.
- make capicommand(progress) "early-B3" usable for non NT-mode incoming channels as well.
- support early Line-Interconnect (bridge) as soon as both B-channels are up. This bridges B-channels

  the original channel callerid.
- added config 'defaultcid' to set a default caller id which will be
  used if dial option 'd' is specified.
- moved ast_softhangup() out of interface lock
- use correct mutex_init call for interface lock
- when 'o' option is used for overlap dialing, do not send any digits
  with the CONNECT_REQ. This gives better progress together with 'b'.

  no global 'interfaces' any more. Section name will be interface name.
- restructured module loading and init.
- dial string changed: parameters like 'b' not as part of number any more.

- better overlap sending (new parameter 'o' for dialstring to
  send only the first two digits with CONNECT_REQ only, the remaining
  digits and even digits following the dial() command, will be send
  as INFO_REQ/Overlap).
