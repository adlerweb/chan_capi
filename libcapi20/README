This Library supports remote CAPI over an TCP/IP network.

On the remote machine you need to have running
 kernelcapi
 libcapi20
 rcapid

On the local machine you just need this libcapi20 and
your application.

For remote configuration the library looks for
  ~/.capi20rc
and if it doesn't exist it looks for
  /etc/capi20.conf

To set the remote machine, the above file need to have
the following line
  REMOTE <remote hostname|ip-address> <remote port>

If this doesn't exist, the library tries the old, normal way
of using the local /dev/capi20.


Trace-Feature:
If the CAPI messages shall be logged, add the following entries to
the configuration file:
  TRACEFILE </path/to/tracefile>
  TRACELEVEL 0|1|2

The tracelevel configured which CAPI messages shall be logged:
 0 = none
 1 = signaling messages
 2 = all (including data messages)
