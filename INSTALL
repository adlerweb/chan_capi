INSTALL
=======

Modify the Makefile to fit your system, especially the path to the Asterisk 
include files.

To build the driver you will need an installed CAPI system, including header 
files.

By default, an internal version of libcapi20 is used (you do not need libcapi20 to
be installed on your system). If you do not want this and the installed libcapi20
should be used, add the option
  USE_OWN_LIBCAPI=no
to the 'make' command.

To build from/for other Asterisk sources (default is '/' where /usr/include/asterisk
is expected), add option
  INSTALL_PREFIX=<where your /usr/include/asterisk is>
to 'make' command. This makes also sense when compiling for other targets or when
cross compiling.


To build the channel module:
---------------------------------
make

For verbose compiling:
---------------------------------
make V=1


To install:
----------------
make install


To install a sample configuration:
----------------------------------
make install_config


In /etc/asterisk/modules.conf insert the line:
    load => chan_capi.so

    and in the [global] section:
    chan_capi.so=yes

Don't forget a trailing newline at the end of modules.conf!
